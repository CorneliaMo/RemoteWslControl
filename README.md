# RemoteWslControl
#### Provide an api to control local wsl2 distros and also GUI for this api (TODO)
#### It's a repeat work cause there're many tools available that can do the same thing
#### If you're looking for a well developed tool for wsl2, please search on web
#### This repository is for my coding practice, and I <u>__won't__</u> solve any submitted issue.
